# Week 1 — Dataset Exploration & Preprocessing Summary

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of Week 1 was to explore, clean, and prepare the **Customer Support Ticket Dataset** for downstream tasks in the End-to-End MLOps pipeline.  
The final classifier will predict support ticket categories — **Billing, Technical, Account, Other** — using **DistilBERT**.  
This phase ensures the data is high quality, balanced, and insight-rich for model training and deployment.

## 📊 Dataset Overview
- **Source:** `data/customer_support_tickets_clean_500.csv`
- **Initial Records:** 500  
- **Final Records after Cleaning:** *(to be updated after cleaning)*  
- **Columns:** `text`, `label`

### Key Cleaning Steps
1. Removed missing `label` and `text` entries.  
2. Normalized labels to the four core classes:  
   - `billing`  
   - `technical`  
   - `account`  
   - `other`
3. Fixed inconsistencies like typos (`Billng` → `billing`, `Tech-support` → `technical`, etc.).  
4. Cleaned text by removing URLs, hashtags, mentions, emojis, and extra spaces.  
5. Converted all text to lowercase and removed HTML entities.

## 🔍 Exploratory Findings

### 1. Label Distribution
- The dataset shows **moderate class imbalance**, with “Other” and “Technical” being slightly dominant.  
- Distribution insights guide **stratified sampling** during model training to maintain fairness.

### 2. Text Length Analysis
- Average ticket length: ~80–120 characters.  
- **Technical** and **Billing** tickets tend to be longer, likely due to detailed issue descriptions.  
- **Account** tickets are shorter and more direct.

### 3. Keyword Analysis
- **Billing:** frequent words include “invoice”, “payment”, “charge”, “refund”.  
- **Technical:** includes “error”, “crash”, “update”, “network”.  
- **Account:** includes “login”, “password”, “access”, “reset”.  
- **Other:** general inquiries like “hello”, “thank”, “question”.

WordCloud visualizations clearly separate context clusters per category — confirming meaningful label-text relationships.

## 🧩 Data Quality Check
| Metric | Result | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Missing labels | 0 | All cleaned |
| Duplicates | ~0–2% | Removed |
| Valid label categories | 4 | Billing, Technical, Account, Other |
| Stratified split | Yes | 80/20 train-test |

## 🧠 Insights Summary
- The dataset is now **ready for tokenization and model fine-tuning** using DistilBERT.  
- Data quality and class balance meet minimum requirements for reliable NLP training.  
- Clear linguistic separation between ticket types ensures the classifier can learn meaningful distinctions.  
- This cleaned dataset supports reproducible results and traceability across future pipeline stages (training, monitoring, deployment).

## 🚀 Next Steps (Week 2 Preview)
1. Tokenize clean text using **DistilBERT tokenizer**.  
2. Build and fine-tune a classification model on the cleaned dataset.  
3. Evaluate using F1-score, accuracy, and confusion matrix.  
4. Log experiments via **MLflow** for MLOps tracking.  
5. Save model artifacts for API deployment in FastAPI.
